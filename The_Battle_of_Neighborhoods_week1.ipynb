The region offers a wide choice of gourmet restaurants, family bistros and the famous wine bars.\n\nBut, when it comes to short gastronomic trips, tourists are always unsure if it is better to travel to Bordeaux, in the southwest of France, or to Paris, already known for the beauty of the city and also for the glamorous gastronomy.\n\nThis project has the purpose of comparing these two gastronomic poles in relation to the quantity and characteristics of their restaurants in order to define which french city is the best in terms of food experiences."
